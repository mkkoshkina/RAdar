# RAdar: SNP2Risk for Rheumatoid Arthritis

üß¨ **An accessible web-based tool that calculates personalized genetic risk scores for rheumatoid arthritis (RA)**

## What is RAdar?

RAdar helps you understand your genetic predisposition to rheumatoid arthritis by analyzing your DNA data. Simply upload your genetic raw data file (VCF format) from popular direct-to-consumer genetic testing services like Genotek and get a personalized Polygenic Risk Score (PRS).

### What is a Polygenic Risk Score?
A Polygenic Risk Score combines information from multiple genetic variants to estimate your genetic risk for developing rheumatoid arthritis compared to the general population. **Important**: This is for educational purposes only and should not replace professional medical advice.

## üöÄ Quick Start

### Prerequisites
- Your genetic raw data file in VCF format
- Docker installed on your system
- Basic familiarity with command line tools

## üìã How to Use
# RAdar Documentation

This repository contains two main components:
1. **A service platform**
2. **RA Polygenic Risk Score Pipeline** - A pipeline for processing VCF files and calculating polygenic risk scores

## Running the Web Application Locally

You can run the web application locally using Docker. This will allow you to leverage all features of RAdar through a web-based interface.

### Steps to Launch the Web Application
1. Ensure you have Docker and Docker Compose installed on your system.
2. Navigate to the root directory of this repository in your terminal.
3. Run the following command to build and start the application:

```bash
docker-compose up --build
```

4. Once the application is running, access it in your web browser at `http://localhost:9002`.

## Command-line Usage

You can also interact with the service using command-line tools like `curl`.

### Health Check

Check if the service is running:

```bash
curl http://localhost:5000/health
```

### Predict Endpoint

Submit a POST request to `/predict` with a JSON payload specifying your VCF file and (optionally) whether to clean temporary files.

**Example using `curl`:**

```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:5000/predict \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "vcf_file": "input/vcf/sample.vcf",
    "clean_tmp": true
  }'
```

- `vcf_file`: Path to your VCF file, relative to the `/input` directory inside the container (e.g., `vcf/sample.vcf`).
- `clean_tmp`: (Optional) Boolean, whether to clean up temporary files after processing (default: `true`).

**Note:**  
The assembly is currently set to `'GRCh37'` by default in the API code. `'GRCh38'` is in progress.

### Output

The API will return a JSON response with the results or an error message:

```json
{"log_file":"log/lm5515.log","output_json":"output/lm5515.json","status":"success","table_snps_used":"output/final_prs_table.tsv"}
```

### System Requirements
- Docker
- Minimum 4GB RAM
- 2GB free disk space

## üìä Repository Structure

This repository contains:

1. **Service Platform**: Web API for processing genetic data
2. **RA Polygenic Risk Score Pipeline**: Core analysis pipeline for VCF processing

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Important Disclaimers

- **Not for medical diagnosis**: Results are for research and educational purposes only
- **Consult healthcare providers**: Always discuss genetic risk with qualified medical professionals
- **Population specificity**: Risk scores may vary by ancestry and population
- **Privacy**: Your genetic data is processed locally and not stored permanently

## üÜò Support

If you encounter issues:
1. Check the log files for error details
2. Ensure your VCF file format is correct
3. Verify your genome build matches GRCh37
4. Open an issue in this repository
